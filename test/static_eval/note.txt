go to stockfish, run make to build stockfish (stockfish executable is created)
go to gull , run make to build gull (gull executable is created)

to evaluate position with gull engine and print the score run :

./gull <<< "position fen r3k2r/Pppp1ppp/1b3nbN/nP6/BBP1P3/q4N2/Pp1P2PP/R2Q1RK1"

the same with stockfish

./stockfish <<< "position fen r3k2r/Pppp1ppp/1b3nbN/nP6/BBP1P3/q4N2/Pp1P2PP/R2Q1RK1"

stockfish also supports detailed evaluation output. Run:

./stockfish <<< "position fen_details r3k2r/Pppp1ppp/1b3nbN/nP6/BBP1P3/q4N2/Pp1P2PP/R2Q1RK1"
(I should add it also for gull)


Note: bash operator <<< to redicrect argument to the stdin, it is the same as running program separately
and providing "position details r3k2r/Pppp1ppp/1b3nbN/nP6/BBP1P3/q4N2/Pp1P2PP/R2Q1RK1" input
(see http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Redirections for more details)


Need to build following script:

PART 1:

There is an input file positions.txt containing sample positions (as fens).
Script should read file and for each fen run stockfish and gull to evaluate position and compare it with the pismo eval.
There should be a way to define threshold which will specify possible deviation from stockfish/gull engines.

//if the value of pismo's engine is inbetween stockfish and gull, status = great
if (stockfish < pismo < gull) || (stockfish > pismo > gull) 
  status = great

if (pismo < min(stockfish, gull) && pismo > min(stockfish,gull) - threshold) )
  status = good

if (pismo > max(stockfish, gull) && pismo < max(stockfish, gull) + threshold) )
  status = good

otherwise it is bad


It should generate output file like this :

(e.g. threshold = 1)

------

Total: (threshold 25)
 great - 5.1% (124123 positions)
 good  - 92.3% (2342342 positions)
 bad - 3.6% (23432423 positions)

pismo | stockfish | gull |  status   |    fen
------------------------------------------------
1.45  |  1.2      | 0.87 |  great    | r3k2r/Pppp1ppp/1b3nbN/nP6/BBP1P3/q4N2/PpP/
2.00  |  1.3      | 1.1  |  good     |  asdfasfasdfa
0.90  |  1.3      | 1.1  |  good     |  asdfasfasdfa
-5    |  -2       | -2.2 |  bad      |  asdfasdfadf
-5    |  -2       | -2.2 |  bad      |  asdfasdfadf
-5    |  -2       | -2.2 |  bad      |  asdfasdfadf
-5    |  -2       | -2.2 |  bad      |  asdfasdfadf

 

PART 2: (develop later, if needed)

it should also generate direcotries (great, good, bad).
Each dir should contain files for each type of output

for aboveexample great dir should contain one file: 1.txt
good dir should contain two files: 1.txt and 2.txt
bad dir shouldl contain  four files: 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, 4.txt

in each file we should have detail output of three engines:
for stockfish as  mentioned above you can get it by running
 ./stockfish <<< "position fen_details r3k2r/Pppp1ppp/1b3nbN/nP6/BBP1P3/q4N2/Pp1P2PP/R2Q1RK1"

for pismo and gull we should add support for it.

-------
script should take two arguments: input file for positions and threshold value
